- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikemadden
- 👀 I’m interested in numerical modeling, science and higher education policy, trivia, electronic music, piano performance, bowling, and golf.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, Python, Git, and CMAQ Applications and Development! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves natural emissions, climate applications, and extreme precipitation. I am currently studying lightning and soil NOx, and how heavy rains could strengthen in a warmer world.
- 📫 How to reach me: by email is good! Or try to find a pub/restaurant that has weekly trivia, I could be there.
